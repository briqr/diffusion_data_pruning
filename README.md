# diffusion_data_pruning
Source code for the paper "Data Pruning in Generative Diffusion Models" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12523)). 

The autoencoder package is taken from [flex_gen framework](https://github.com/HelmholtzAI-FZJ/flex_gen).

to run the training script, please adjust train_script.sbatch

to evaluate fid, please adjust evaluate_fid.sbatch


Pretrained models will be released on google drive soon. 

Source code has been taken and adapted from additional frameworks:

[DiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT)

[SiT](https://github.com/willisma/SiT)

[torch-kmeans](https://github.com/jokofa/torch_kmeans)
